## Usage :wrench:

> ### __Register an account__
On the home page, simply __register a new account__. This will prompt a verification form.

> ### __Enter the secret code__
By this point, the program already sent an email that you registered with. Check it out, it should contain the verification code

> ### __Use the API key__
If the verification code is correct, your API key will be generated. Use it like the example of the 3rd image above.
